This build is derived from the manual build section of the official [islandora documentation](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/installation/manual/introduction/)

This build is intended for use in a vmware virtualmachine running ubuntu server 22.04.

You will need shared folders enabled on the virtualmachine. Download the shared folders from the [LSU Onedrive](https://lsumail2.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Team-LIB-WebDev/Shared%20Documents/LDL/LDL-2/islandora8_Build_Instructions/shared_vmware_files_for_building/real_shared?csf=1&web=1&e=0fvyiQ)

Add the shared folder to your vmware's shared folder, instructions for connecting shared folders are in the Build Instructions.
